manually produce a meta.xml file
manually produce an EML metadata file
scalafy the reader code
read in dwca in scala using gbif reader
save in database
get licence(s) for intellij
ping tim with validator plan 
investigate the validator
what do we need to do re sample, survey, (dataset) that already exist / don' already exist?
look at the metadata standard in NXF and work out the things we need to import

read in EML metadata - parse xml
save in database

run all scalatests from idea
run scalatests from maven
ask gbif whether dwca reader is tested with large (?) files (it makes a copies of them)
set up a logging framework similar to BARS importer
set up dependency injection
use scala 2.9.1 to fix my console - what's the problem in netbeans exactly? 


parse EML metadata
open dwca reader
begin tx
upsert dataset, samples and surveys
loop through the records
  get survey for this dataset using key
    create it if not exists
  get sample for this dataset using key
    create it if not exists
  upsert observation
