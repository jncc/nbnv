manually produce a meta.xml file
manually produce an EML metadata file
scalafy the reader code

read in dwca in scala using gbif reader
save in database

look at the metadata standard in NXF and work out the things we need to import
(which all should be in the EML)
read in EML metadata - use scala XML stuff? or gbif reader
save in database
run all scalatests from idea
run scalatests from maven
ask gbif whether dwca reader is tested with large (?) files (it makes a copies of them)
set up a logging framework similar to BARS importer
set up dependency injection
use scala 2.9.1 to fix my console - what's the problem in netbeans exactly? 


Use EML for our metadata
