# Getting better access to records

Once registered you have access to records at the resolution granted to the public by the data providers. If this public resolution is not adequate then you can request enhanced access to the full records through the NBN Gateway. Your account page provides the links to request and review the status of your requests.

Click on ['Create New Access Request'](/AccessRequest/Create) to go to the access request form. Guidance on how to fill out this form is provided below (see [Filling in the Request Enhanced Access Form](../Filling_in_the_Request_Enhanced_Access_form))
Click on ['View Your Access Requests'](/AccessRequest) to see the current status of your access requests

Remember to login to automatically receive your additional enhanced access when using the NBN Gateway to map and view species records. Links to the access request form are also provided directly from a number of NBN Gateway pages so that you can request enhanced access for your current search criteria.

If you are a member of an organisation on the NBN Gateway then this organisation can also request enhanced access on your behalf. Your account page provides the links to request and review your status of organisation membership on the NBN Gateway.

Click on ['Join an Organisation'](/Organisations/Join) to request to become a member of an organisation on the NBN Gateway.
View the status of your organisation membership in 'Your Organisation Membership' section.
