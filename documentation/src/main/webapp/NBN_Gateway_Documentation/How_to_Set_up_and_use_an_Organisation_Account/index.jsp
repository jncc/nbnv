#HOW TO SET UP AND USE AN ORGANISATION ACCOUNT

#ORGANISATION ACCOUNTS

In addition to individual user accounts, it is also possible to register an organisation account on the Gateway. Individual users can apply to become a member of an organisation with an account on the Gateway. By doing so individual users can inherit the level of access given to the organisation account by data providers. This enables a recognised group or organisation to build a coherent level of access for its members or staff.  For example, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has an organisation account on the NBN Gateway. A member of SEPA staff administers this account. This individual has access to online administration controls that enable them to add and remove individual users as members.

##HOW TO REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR YOUR ORGANISATION 
1. [Download and complete the Gateway Organisation Registration Form.](resources/OrganisationRegistrationForm_v2.doc)
2. Submit the completed form following the instructions on the form. You will be notified when the organisation account has been created.
 
##HOW TO UPDATE AND MANAGE YOUR ORGANISATION ACCOUNT
The individual you appointed to administer your organisation account is able to access and use online tools to manage the account.
 
1. Go to data.nbn.org.uk or nbn.org.uk
2. Click LOG IN from the very top right hand side of the homepage, enter you details and click LOG IN
2. Click MY ACCOUNT on the top right hand corner of the page.
3. Find and click "you manage" under the Organisations subtitle at the bottom left.
 
From here you can update your organisation description/details, manage members of you account (add members and add administrators), and request access to datasets on behalf of you organisation account. This is the only place on the Gateway that enhanced access to datasets can be requested on behalf of your organisation account.
