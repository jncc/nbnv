#HOW TO USE THE SEARCH ENGINE

If you know the name of the site or species you are interested in the Gateway Search Engine offers a quick way to find relevant data and other resources. To use the Search Engine you must type the name of a species or a wildlife site in the UK into the Searchbox. The Searchbox is located at the top right of every page.

The Search Engine results page has a standard format. The results page is split into four tabs one each for Species, Sites, Related Websites and NBN Information. The results within each tab are ordered by relevance. 

On the species search results tab, for example, a search for Bombus displays the species results on top, with 25 relevant records beginning with Bombus  - bumble bee, then Bombus cullumanus - Cullum's Bumble Bee, then Bombus distinguendus - Great Yellow Bumble Bee etc. There are four options for each species result:

1. Grid map of the distribution of Bombus. - to see a national map of available records
2. Distribution of Bombus on protected sites. - to generate a site report
3. Interactive distribution map of Bombus. - to see records on the interactive mapper
4. Taxonomic information for Bombus - to see NBN Species Dictionary taxonomy
There are no sites associated with a search for Bombus. The Related Websites results provide links to bumble bee images on the website BioImages: The Virtual Field Guide. and the NBN information results tab displays NBN related web pages and documents

The Search Engine provides the main route in to map species records available through the NBN Gateway. There are two main data mapping tools on the Gateway. These are the Grid Map and Interactive Mapper.
