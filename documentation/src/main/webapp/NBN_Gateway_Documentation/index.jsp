#INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDEBOOK

The Gateway users' guidebook is for anyone needing practical assistance on how to use the Gateway. The following sections will help you build an understanding of the Gateway, how it operates and the sort of information the Gateway can provide. The guidebook is split into two sections

* An introduction to using the Gateway resources - ideal for anyone wishing to gain a sound understanding of what the Gateway is and
* A step by step guide on how to use the main Gateway functions - use this if you just want to get stuck in and start using the Gateway

The NBN Gateway is a web-based tool developed to help any organisation share the wildlife resources they hold with others. The NBN Gateway provides a single point of access over the internet to wildlife information held by a wide range of organisations and groups. The website provides a secure environment in which data providers can manage how they share their data. For more information on what the Gateway aims to do and to gain access to the site please visit the resources section
