#HOW TO REGISER AND USE YOUR ACCOUNT

#REGISTERED INDIVIDUALS

Anyone can register as an individual user on the NBN Gateway. Registration gives you an individual user account. You can use this account to request new or better access to datasets and to apply for membership of Registered Organisations on the Gateway.

#REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS

In addition to individual user accounts it is also possible to register an organisation account on the Gateway. Individual users can apply to become a member of an organisation with an account on the Gateway. By doing so individual users can inherit the level of access given to the organisation by data providers. This enables a recognised group or organisation to build a coherent level of access for its members or staff.  For example, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has an organisation account on the NBN Gateway. A member of SEPA staff administers this account. This individual has access to online administration controls that enable them to add and remove individual users as members.
