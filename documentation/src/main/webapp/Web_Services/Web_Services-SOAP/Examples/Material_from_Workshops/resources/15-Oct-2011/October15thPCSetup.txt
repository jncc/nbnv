The NBN web services workshop run on 15th October 2011 required the attendees machines to be setup as described below.  If you want to try the exercises in the workshop you will need to set up your environment as follows.

Install the following software:

1. EasyPHP: which is downloaded from http://www.easyphp.org/ - this gives you an apache web server, my sql database and php on your local windows machine 

2. SOAPUI: available from http://www.soapui.org/ - this is used to consume our web service description language file (WSDL) and generate skeleton requests for the attendees to use in their php pages

Notepad++:  available from http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ - used to edit the php files in

Once that is installed, EasyPHP will need a tiny bit of configuring for the workshop:

1.  Download nusoap-0.9.5.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/ - this is a php library we need to add to WAMP.  It needs to be unzipped into the folder '<php installation directory>\www\lib' - where '<php installation directory>' will be something like  'C:\Program Files
(x86)\EasyPHP-5.3.8.0\' and 'lib' will probably need creating.

2.  Test as follows:
- Start EasyPHP: Start > EasyPHP 5.3.8.x - an EasyPHP icon will appear in system tray
- Save the attached file (test.php) into the folder '<php installation
directory>\www\nbn\'
- Open a browser and go to 'http://localhost/nbn/test.php' - the page should have a distribution map that shows the coastline of the UK and Ireland and with red squares mostly in Norfolk indicating all is working fine.

FINALLY - add the php pages used in the exercises - open http://www.nbn.org.uk/Guidebooks/Web-services-documentation/Examples/Workshops/phpExamples.aspx and in the zip file extract /nbn/*.php and copy to <php installation
directory>\www\nbn\
