#NBN Gateway Privacy Policy

##General

We want to protect the privacy of visitors to our website and that of the people
who supply us with wildlife data. Please read the following policy; it will help
you to understand how we use your personal data. We may change our privacy policy
at any time without giving you notice, so please check it each time you visit 
this website.

Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection and use
in accordance with this privacy policy, including our use of cookies as 
explained below.

##What personal data do we collect?

###Gateway Users
We automatically collect data about visitors to our website (for example on 
browsing patterns) by using Cookies. (See below.) We log your Internet Protocol 
(IP) address in order to receive and send information from and to you over the 
Internet. When you register as a Gateway User on our website you may be asked 
to provide the following personal data: your name, e-mail address, the name of
the organisation to which you are affiliated, and a password of your own choosing.

###Data Providers
When you provide us with a dataset we may ask you for the name of the 
organisation that manages the information it contains, a relevant website 
address, the name of an individual or post to act as our primary point of 
contact, their telephone number and email address.

###Dataset Administrators
We ask that you appoint at least one Dataset Administrator for each dataset you 
supply. We may ask administrators for their name, email address and telephone number.

Bear in mind that if you submit any personal data for inclusion in any directory 
or information service, it may be seen by anyone visiting this website with 
access to that directory or information service. Do not submit any personal 
data that you do not want to be made available in this way, and please do not 
send us any personal data about anyone else without their permission.

##Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where 
services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small 
amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. 
These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you
personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through:

*   enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the 
    same information several times during one task

*   recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you 
    don't need to do it for every web page requested

*   measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to 
    use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast

You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through
[Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them](http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies)

##How do we use your personal data?

###Gateway Users

Cookies are used to monitor use of the Gateway to help inform its future 
development, and are used only in an anonymous form; no individual is identified.

We use the personal data you provide on registration for the following purposes: 
a) to provide you with a personal user account to which Data Administrators can
allocate individual access rights to control the level of access you have to 
their datasets, b) to allow us to operate account administration, c) to enable 
us to keep you informed about site developments, new data resources, 
publications or events in which you may be interested, and to inform you about 
changes and improvements to our website and services, d) to monitor the access 
request mechanism.

We may also use your personal data to monitor the use of the site, to record 
traffic flows and to carry out research about our visitors demographics, 
interests and behaviour. We do this to better understand our visitors and help 
inform the development and evolution of our service. This research is compiled 
and analysed on an aggregated and anonymous basis. Personal identification 
information is not used in this research.

When you give us personal data, those data may be sent electronically to servers
 anywhere in the world and may be used, stored and processed anywhere in the 
world, including countries outside the European Economic Area.
*(Bear in mind that many countries outside the EEA do not adequately protect your rights as a data subject.)*

Whenever and wherever we collect, process or use personal data, we take steps 
to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with our privacy policy.

###Dataset Administrators

We use your personal data for the following purposes: a) to provide you with a 
personal administrator account to allow you to control the level of access 
different Gateway Users have to the datasets you supply, b) to allow us operate 
your account administration, c) to enable us to keep you informed about site 
developments, new data resources, publications or events in which you may be 
interested, and to inform you about changes and improvements to our website and 
services, d) to monitor Gateway User access levels and your processing of access
requests.

##To whom might we disclose your personal data?

We may make your personal data available to the organisations administering 
access to the datasets they have on our website, and additionally to anyone who 
needs the data in order for us to facilitate your service requests. Some of 
these people may be located outside the European Economic Area.

We may pass your personal data to our members or associated companies and to 
our data processors and website hosting organisation. Some of these may be 
located outside the European Economic Area.

We may also provide your personal data to businesses (which may or may not be 
companies in our group) which may be located outside the European Economic Area 
and who may use the data to send you information about other products or 
services. [However, you may opt-out of your personal data being used in this way
when we collect your personal data.]

We may also provide your personal data to Agents acting on behalf of the NBNT 
and anyone who takes over NBNT activities in the future.

Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information unless 
we are obliged to do so or allowed to do so by law, or where we need to do so in
order to run the NBNT charity (for instance where we outsource services or other
people process data for us). [In those circumstances we ask those other people 
to give us confidentiality or non-disclosure undertakings.]
