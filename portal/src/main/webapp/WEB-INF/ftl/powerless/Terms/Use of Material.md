2.  The material, data and/or information you access may be subject to Specific 
    Terms of Access and/or Use imposed by the Data Provider. Where Specific 
    Terms of Access and/or Use have been identified for a dataset they are 
    provided within the "Access Constraint" and/or "Use Constraint" field of 
    the Metadata for that dataset. If there is any conflict or inconsistency 
    between these Gateway Terms & Conditions and the Specific Terms of Access 
    and/or Use, the latter will prevail, but only in relation to the particular 
    material, data and/or information restricted by those Specific Terms of 
    Access and/or Use, and only to the extent necessary to resolve that conflict
    or inconsistency.

3.  Under these Gateway Terms & Conditions you are permitted to view and 
    download any material, data and/or information that Data Providers allow

    reference to a particular wildlife record you must acknowledge the Original 
    Recorder [where their name is made available].

5.  Data Providers may restrict the availability of some or all parts of the 
    material, data and/or information they supply for a variety of reasons using
    the Access Administration Controls on the NBN Gateway. If you are granted 
    access to restricted information you must not disseminate, deliberately 
    compromise or otherwise infringe the confidentiality of such information 
    without first obtaining written permission from the relevant Data Provider. 
    Any published interpretations or representations you make based on the 
    information must be equivalent to the level of information available to 
    non-registered users on this website.

    (unless stated by the standard license) without first obtaining written

    provided within the metadata of the relevant dataset].

8.  Datasets with a standard data license (OGL, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, etc) are 
    governed by the particulars of the data license.  These licenses override
