<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A revised version of the NBN Gateway web services (NBN Gateway API) will be released later in 2013. Ahead of that release it is recognised that some consumers may wish to begin to develop (or redevelop) applications and also contribute to more generally testing the new suite of services. With this in mind a BETA version of the API is being made available as a limited release. While various steps have been taken to minimise the inadvertent leakage of data through this period, the fact that the system is still under development means there remains a risk of such leakage occurring. The primary reason for these restrictions is to manage this possibility.</p>
<p>This document is a license for that BETA version of the NBN Gateway API. It contains a number of restrictions and conditions that apply to the use of the API and its documentation.  The conditions will be relaxed when the API enters into full release.</p>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>The conditions for use of this document and the API itself are:</p>

<p>In no event shall the NBN/JNCC/CEH be liable to you or any third parties for any special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind, or any damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, those resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether or not the NBN/JNCC/CEH has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and on any theory of liability, arising out of or in connection with the use of this API.</p>
<p>The use of the API is done at your own discretion and risk and with agreement that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from such activities.
