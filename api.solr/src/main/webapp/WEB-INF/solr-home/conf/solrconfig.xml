       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

       ** Experimental Feature **

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent
       certain other features from working. The API to
       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be
       resolved.


       ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a
       custom IndexReader implementation may cause incompatibility
       with ReplicationHandler and may cause replication to not work
       correctly. See SOLR-1366 for details.

         There are two implementations of cache available for Solr,

         FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap.  

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be
         faster under other scenarios on multi-cpu systems.

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

         Parameters:
           class - the SolrCache implementation LRUCache or
               (LRUCache or FastLRUCache)

        matching the query. If found, the filter will be used as the
        source of document ids, and then the sort will be applied to
        that.

        frequently get the same search repeatedly with different sort

        are collected.  For example, if a search for a particular query
        requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize 
        is 50, then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.
